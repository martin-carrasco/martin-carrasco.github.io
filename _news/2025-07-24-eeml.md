Best summer school of the season, definitly will do an [EEML](https://eeml.eu) again. My favourite talk was on natural gradients by [James Marten](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LlK_saMAAAAJ&hl=en). Very cool topic! Working on optimization seems very relevant, much of what we do in ML to some extent is magic and the people doing the heavy lifting in this regard are definitely on the learning theory side of things...
