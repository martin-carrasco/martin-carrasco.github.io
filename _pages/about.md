I am [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/phd-postdoc) Doctoral Student @ [AIDOS](https://aidos.group) supervised by [Prof. Bastian Rieck](https://bastian.rieck.me) and co-supervised by [Prof. Søren Hauberg](https://www2.compute.dtu.dk/~sohau/).

My research focuses on *geometrical* and *topological* methods in machine learning. In a nutshell, I
**really** like graphs and shapes. Also seems like they can be useful in AI.

## Past work
I started my journey in applications of [topological deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_deep_learning) when working with [Dr. Telyatnikov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MzFz-tcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Bernardez](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=YUye6xwAAAAJ&hl=es) from [REAL AI](https://www.ai.ece.ucsb.edu). We have a preprint out on **efficient** ways to perform *higher-order message passing*. Check it out [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15405v1?trk=feed-detail_main-feed-card_feed-article-content) .

## Current work & Thesis
For my M.Sc. thesis I was supervised by [Prof. Erik Bekkers](https://ebekkers.github.io) from [AMLab](http://amlab.science.uva.nl) and [Prof. Bastian Rieck](https://bastian.rieck.me). I explored an alternative metric that fully characterizes attributed graphs, it's relationship to homomorphism counts and how it can, in expectation, completly characterize these objects.

### My current interests

My thesis topic revolves around the limitations in the current expressivity meassures used to quantify the expressive power of GNNs. I believe that we are being too "square" when looking at graphs and we should step out of the box since this expressivity has some practical limitaitons.
