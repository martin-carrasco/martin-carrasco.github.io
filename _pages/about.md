Hello, I am Martin Carrascoâ€”an incoming Doctoral Student at Fribourg University supervised by [Prof. Bastian Rieck](https://bastian.rieck.me). My research focuses on *geometrical* and *topological* methods in machine learning, with a particular interest in theoretically motivated approaches that leverage differential geometry and algebraic topology. Currently, I am working with [Dr. Telyatnikov](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MzFz-tcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Bernardez](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=YUye6xwAAAAJ&hl=es) from [REAL AI](https://www.ai.ece.ucsb.edu) in finding **efficient** alternatives to message passing for [topological deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_deep_learning). Additionally, I am collaborating with [Prof. Erik Bekkers](https://ebekkers.github.io) from [AMLab](http://amlab.science.uva.nl) on equivariant message passing on point clouds using simplicial and cellular complex representations.
